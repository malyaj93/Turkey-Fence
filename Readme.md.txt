  ____________PROJECT DESCRITPION_______________                                                                         
                                                                                                                             
     The file participants.csv contains meeting attendance data reported by Zoom for the first three weeks of a course.       
     Each row contains the name of a student along with the number of minutes that the student was logged                     
     in to the course Zoom meeting. (The names of students have been changed to protect the innocent.)                       
                                                                                                                             
     1. Use the csv module to load and examine the dataset.                                                                  
     2. Find the quartiles for Week 1. You may wish to consult the Python Sorting                                            
        HOW TO document for help manipulating the data.                                                                      
     3. In order to record attendance, we want to find the students who logged into the Zoom meeting but                     
        did not attend the entire lecture. In order to do this, we can look for outliers in the data.                        
                                                                                                                             
        Tukey’s fences are a simple method to define outliers in terms of the interquartile range.                           
        Use this method with k = 1.5 to find the outliers in the Week 1 attendance data.                                     
     4. Repeat experiments (2) and (3) for Weeks 2 and 3.                                                                    
     5. Consolidate your code from experiments (2) through (4) into a Python function named tardy().                         
        You may wish to define other functions as well.                                                                      
                                                                                                                             
        This function should list the name and attendance statistics for any student whose attendance in any week falls      
        below the bottom fence for that week. Tardy students should be listed in the same                                    
        order as they appear in the original .csv file.
